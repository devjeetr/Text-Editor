# Text-Editor
A simple editor that supports large files using piece tables and memory mapped io

I started this project in my first year, but I had to put it on hold after a few quarters. I never got back to it, but I uploaded it
here because some parts of it are complete(like the piece table and the basics of the custom edit control).
